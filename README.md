# CD Pipeline using AWS
Developed a continuous delivery pipeline for a small web application in this project. 
To store my source code, I first used a version control system. 
Then, I set up a continuous delivery pipeline that will deploy the web application automatically anytime the source code is updated. 
This project uses GitHub, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodePipeline.
